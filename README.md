I have spent most of my life in IT. I'm self-motivated and can solve complex tasks in a short time. I can provide you with a full set of services to help you realize your business idea, starting from business analysis through design and implementation phases to stabilization, deployment, and maintenance of the end product.

I'm a fast learner and can easily adjust to new programming languages and adapt to new environments. I have a passion for clean and neat web interfaces that produce seamless user experiences.

In the past two years, my main roles were architecture planning, choosing the right technology stack based on client requirements, development, and team management.

I like Agile and use it every day—iterations, scrum daily meetings, retrospectives.
